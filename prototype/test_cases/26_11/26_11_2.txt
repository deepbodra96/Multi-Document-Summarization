According to investigation by various agencies, 10 terrorists were spotted by a local fisherman as they disembarked from their dinghy boat near Badhwar Park. They offloaded their bags full of explosives and carried AK47 assault rifles in their rucksacks.
Of the ten LeT terrorists, eight got off near the fishing sacks on the shore. Two of gunmen went back into the sea. Later, investigation showed that the two headed to their targets at Trident and Oberoi - both 5-star hotels - at Nariman Point.
The eight terrorists, who got off at Machchhimar Nagar near Badhwar Park in Mumbai's Cuffe Parade area, split into four pairs - the fisherman told the investigators. The first eyewitness reportedly challenged the eight men but they ignored his warnings and spread across the city to create mayhem for three days in Mumbai killing around 25 foreigners among others.
Each of the terrorists carried AK47 automatic rifle, around 500 rounds of ammunition, pistols, hand grenades and improvised explosive devices. The ammunition possessed by them proved enough for the Mumbai police and special commandos to keep them at toes for next three days.
Around 9.20 pm took place the first attack at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. Fifty-eight people were killed at the CST railway station in an indiscriminate gunfiring that lasted for about one-and-a-half-hour. Mohammed Ajmal Kasab and Ismail Khan had targeted the CST.
The second attack was reported about 8-10 minutes later from the Nariman House area, the second group of terrorists blew up a gas station before attacking Jewish Chabad Lubavitch outreach centre. The rabbi, his wife and five Israeli hostages were killed. Miraculously, the two-year-old child of the rabbi survived as his housemaid smuggled the baby to safety.
