Leopold Cafe, another upscale restaurant was the third target of the terrorists, who opened fire at the dining crowd almost at the same time as the attack at the Nariman House locality. The terrorists - identified later as Shoaib and Umer, who targeted the diners at Leopold Cafe, headed to the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel and planted bombs in taxis on their way.
At the Taj, terrorists Shoaib and Umer met with LeT gunmen - identified as Abdul Rehman Bada and Abu Ali, who had left IED for the Leopold Cafe attackers outside the iconic hotel. The Taj came under attack between 9.35 pm and 10 pm. Oberoi-Trident Hotel was the last site to be attacked by the terrorists around the same time as the Taj. The terrorists entered the hotel through restaurant and started pumping bullets into the gathered crowd.
Ajmal Kasab was the only terrorist to be captured alive. After attacking CST railway station, he and Ismail Khan had targeted the Cama Hospital. From there he ambushed a police team, killed six officials including ATS chief Hemant Karkare and hijacked their jeep.
Kasab and Ismail Khan were intercepted near Girgaum Chowpatty, where Tukaram Omble grabbed the barrel of the rifle the former was firing from. This gave the police team time to overpower Kasab and capture him. He was tried and sentenced to death in May 2010. Kasab was hanged at the Yerawada jail in Pune in November 2012.
